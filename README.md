# Data-Science
Here i upload my data science projects
This conatin complete machine learning projects that i have worked on . 
It contains almost all the algorithms such as logistic regeresion, decision trees, support vector machines 
I have uploaded the datasets that i used for the purpose of analyzing and building models.Although these datsets are easily available on web or on kaggle.
The main feature of this repository is that it contains my project of building ENSEMBLE MODELS
but i have tried to include other concepts of machine learning which i learnt during practicing, so basically it conatins my projects which i have used to learn machine learning concepts.
